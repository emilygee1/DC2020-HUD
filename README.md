### An Analysis of Affordable and Sustainable Housing

This project is based on datasets provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides annual rental subsidy to 9.5 million individuals in 4.6 million households. There are multiple subsidy programs, but they serve the same basic function of providing a monthly subsidy to make housing affordable for extremely low-income households. These programs include: public housing, multi-family housing, and housing choice voucher. Additional information can be found [here.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/datalinkage/primer-on-hud-programs.pdf)

Our analysis aims to answer the following research questions:
* Why is housing important?
* How have the household characteristics of HUD programs changed from 2009 to 2018?
* Can we predict program type based on demographics and external variables?
* How is housing important to sustainability?
* What can HUD do to improve these programs?

Given the time constraints, our project allows for the following opportunities for improvement and further analysis:
* Expand on exploratory analysis.
* Correct class imbalance to improve model accuracy.
* Utilize more thorough feature selection.
