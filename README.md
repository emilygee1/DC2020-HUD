# UMD Data Challenge 2020

This project is based on datasets provided by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides annual rental subsidy to 9.5 million individuals in 4.6 million households. There are multiple subsidy programs, but they serve the same basic function of providing a monthly subsidy to make housing affordable for primarily extremely low-income households. These programs include: public housing, multi-family housing, and housing choice voucher. Additional information can be found [here.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/datalinkage/primer-on-hud-programs.pdf)

Our analysis aims to answer the following research questions:
* How have the household characteristics of HUD programs changed from 2009 to 2018?
* Are certain groups more attracted to some HUD programs than others?
* Why is housing important?
* How is housing important to sustainability?
* How can housing be made accessible?
